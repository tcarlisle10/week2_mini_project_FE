        <article>
            <p>I grew up in a small town where being outdoors was a big part of my life. From a young age, I spent countless hours exploring the woods and learning to appreciate nature. As I got older, I became more involved in sports, playing baseball as a kid, then transitioning to football and track in middle school. I also started spending more time with friends, playing video games and enjoying the mix of outdoor activities and technology.

                After high school, I pursued my passion for hands-on work and became a welder. For 10 years, I dedicated myself to the craft, building a strong foundation in fabrication and metalwork. Welding was my career goal, and I was proud to achieve it. But during that time, I also found myself drawn to computers. Iâ€™d always thought coding was fascinating and knew it was something I wanted to explore more deeply.
                
                After suffering a back injury while welding, I decided it was time for a career change. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to transition into coding, a field that had intrigued me for years. Now, I'm focused on developing my skills in tech, excited to combine my practical experience with my passion for problem-solving and technology.</p>
